## About this API Documentation
The platform API documentation portal is an interactive, searchable, online portal where you can learn, understand, and explore the technicalities of each API within our platform.
Integrating our platform APIs just got easier and faster! Our Platform API documentation contains conceptual overviews, detailed definitions of fields, and working code examples that you can try out. With the rich content in our documentation portal, you can find answers to the what, why, and how of our travel API world.
### Navigate within the documentation
The documentation is divided into three columns, namely the *Table of Contents*, the *API Overview*, and the *API Specs Console* sections. This makes it easier for you to navigate through the documentation and get to the required type of information faster.

#### Table of Contents section
The *Table of Contents* contains an outline of the complete list of topics in the API documentation. With the *Table of Contents*, you can directly navigate to any topic without having to scroll through a wide range of information. To directly view information for a specific topic, on the *Table of Contents*, click the link for the topic that you want to view. The content for the topic that you clicked automatically appears in the [*API Overview*](#apioverview) section.
Additionally, when you click a topic link that contains a list of subtopics or subsections, the list of subtopics automatically appears under the main topic in the *Table of Contents* section. To view information for a subtopic, on the *Table of Contents* section, click the subtopic link.
#### API Overview section
<a name="apioverview"></a>The *API Overview* section contains conceptual overviews and long-form descriptions of the APIs. The *API Overview* section helps you gain insight during the discovery phase where you are finding out what an API can do.
Each verb in the API corresponds to a clickable bar within the *API Overview* section. When you click this bar, detailed information about the API and its code samples appear in the [*API Specs Console*](#apispecsconsole) section.

#### API Specs Console section
<a name="apispecsconsole"></a>The *API Specs Console* section provides the field descriptions, code samples in a language of your choice, expected results, and it even lets you [try out the APIs] (#tryout).
The *API Specs Console* section has two views, namely the Example view (default) and the Console view. You can easily toggle between these views by clicking the *Switch to Console* or *Switch to Example* button at the top of the *API Specs Console* section.
The *Example* view provides the field descriptions, code samples in a language of your choice, and the expected results.

### Try out the APIs
<a name="tryout"></a>With our platform API documentation portal, you can now customize field values and try out the APIs directly from within your browser.
The [*Console*](#consoleview) view in the *API Specs Console* section allows you to create requests and send it to the production server or the mock server. You can also edit the URL variables or HTTP headers for your request. After you make a call, you can view code examples for your request in a language of your choice.
To try out the APIs:<br>
1. (Skip this step if you are already in the Console view) At the top of the *API Specs Console* section, click the *Switch to Console* button.<br>
2. Customize the headers and field values, as required. If you want to set the field values to the values that were provided in the samples, click *Reset Values*.<br>
3. Click the server on which you want to call the resource. You can call the resource on the mock server or the production server.<br>
4. Click *Call Resource*.
### Search for information
To search for information within the platform API documentation portal, you can use your browser's *Find* feature. In most browsers, pressing *CTRL+F* displays the *Search* box on your browser. You can then type the keyword for the information that you are looking for and get to the appropriate section in the documentation. For example, if you want to know more about the *Initiate Search* API, press *CTRL+F*, type *initiate*, and then press *ENTER* until you get to the appropriate section.
